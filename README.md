# Minitab Data Exploration – Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains my final project analyzing the impact of the **ReFresh Spot**, a community resource in Skid Row providing essential services for unhoused individuals. The project utilizes statistical analysis in **Minitab** to evaluate survey data collected from facility users, assessing changes in emotional well-being, comfort, and self-consciousness.

Additionally, this repository includes **PR1-4**, which contain various preliminary statistical analyses conducted throughout the course. These projects demonstrate different applications of statistical methods and data exploration techniques in Minitab.

## Project Background
The **ReFresh Spot** is a community-driven facility offering 24/7 access to showers, restrooms, laundry, and other essential services. A survey of **168 users** was conducted to measure the facility’s impact on their well-being. My analysis focuses on identifying statistical trends to determine whether the ReFresh Spot positively influences its users.

## Methods and Analysis
Using Minitab, I performed several statistical tests to explore key research questions:
- **Paired t-test:** Evaluated changes in happiness before and after visiting the facility.
- **One-way ANOVA:** Compared comfort levels across different age groups.
- **Two-way ANOVA:** Assessed the effects of age and gender on self-consciousness.
- **Chi-square test:** Examined the relationship between age and first-time visits.
- **Mann-Whitney test:** Compared helpfulness ratings between younger and older users.

## Key Findings
- **Happiness levels significantly increased** after using the ReFresh Spot.
- **Comfort levels remained consistent** across age groups.
- **Gender had a significant impact** on self-consciousness levels.
- **Younger users found the facility more helpful** than older users.

## Files in This Repository
- **Final Project.pdf** – Full report detailing the research, methodology, and results.
- **Minitab Analysis Files (coming soon)** – Data files and output from Minitab.
- **PR1-4** – Various preliminary reports demonstrating statistical techniques, hypothesis testing, and data visualization using Minitab.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the **positive impact** of the ReFresh Spot while identifying areas for potential improvement. This project, along with **PR1-4**, showcases my ability to apply Minitab to real-world statistical problems, exploring patterns in data and deriving meaningful insights.
